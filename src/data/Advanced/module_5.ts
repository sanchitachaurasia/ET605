          <p>For a data scientist, probability is the bridge between historical trends and future optimization. We don't just calculate chances; we build predictive models. In the high-stakes world of finance and logistics, a deviation of 1% in probability can result in millions of dollars in difference.</p>
          <p>Consider <strong>Risk Assessment</strong>. When an insurance company calculates your premium, they are performing multi-step data handling. They look at your age, location, and habits. Each factor adjusts the "Expected Loss" probability. If data shows that 1 in 1,000 drivers in your category has an accident per year, the theoretical probability is 0.001. That number determines the price of your insurance.</p>
          
          <div class="stage-marker explain"></div>
          <p>In modern sports, we move beyond simple averages to <strong>Conditional Probability</strong>. We don't just ask, "Will this player score?" We ask, "Given the current weather conditions and the opponent's defensive formation, what is the probability of a successful pass?" This requires analyzing sub-sets of data—filtering the total data set to find the most relevant <strong>Sample Space</strong>. <span class="vcue">[Display graph: Pass completion rates vs Defensive Pressure levels]</span></p>

          <p>Large corporations like Amazon or Netflix rely on the <strong>Law of Large Numbers</strong>. On an individual level, a user's behavior is unpredictable (Experimental Probability). However, when looking at 100 million users, the aggregate data becomes almost deterministic. This allows for automated inventory management—where a computer uses historical probability to "pre-ship" items to a warehouse near you before you even click "Buy."</p>

            If a business has a 95% success rate for on-time delivery, but a major storm has a 30% probability of occurring and would delay all shipments, how does the <strong>Joint Probability</strong> change their risk profile?
